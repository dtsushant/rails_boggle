I was unable to find a free Word validation API without Credit Card Registry so I've used DB based dictionary to validate the word

The word list has been copied from a github contributor https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt

Tutorial followed to learn react and rails https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-ruby-on-rails-project-with-a-react-frontend

I am using mysql as native database so please be sure to have a mysql installation 

please set the proper db user / password in database.yml file inside config

After setting database please run rails db:migrate 

After running the db:migrate please run rails:seed

Deploy the application
